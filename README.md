## Proposal 1

Because of my interest in healthcare, and due to the recent surging of COVID cases nationwide, I think it would be interesting and relevant to use current COVID data coupled with metadata from States and Counties to try to create a model that can predict surges in COVID. I believe using Random Forest or some kind of Ensemble method would produce good results. The Data Set is on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university and contains global data as well (which I may use for some introductory graphing purposes), but gets fine-grained with US COVID data.

## Proposal 2

This dataset contains images of normal and pneumonia-riddled lungs (approx. 6000 images) and the goal would be to manipulate the images into a classifier that could predict with some degree of accuracy whether or not a person has pneumonia just by seeing an x-ray of their lungs. My concern is that the dataset is a bit too small, but since each image contains a lot of data perhaps 6000 images is a sufficient number. That data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

## Proposal 3

Another possible dataset for me to use is a collection of data about women in several states in India. The data indicate many different factors (access to amenities, family planning strategies, relationship info, to name a few), and the goal is to predict the outcome of the woman's pregnancy (whether live birth, still birth, or aborted). I think with all of the information provided in this data set it would be challenging to narrow down the features to only those which are actually important in the determination of the prediction, which would then give possible insight into why some women may or may not choose abortion in India.
