# Predicting Pneumonia

## Proposal

This dataset contains images of normal and pneumonia-riddled lungs (approx. 6000 images) and the goal would be to manipulate the images into a classifier that could predict with some degree of accuracy whether or not a person has pneumonia just by seeing an x-ray of their lungs. My concern is that the dataset is a bit too small, but since each image contains a lot of data perhaps 6000 images is a sufficient number. That data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

I chose X-ray image classification for a few reasons. I have a background in bioethics from my Philosophy studies, so I wanted to do something that had a medical bend, but on a more personal level I am interested in the possibility of computer vision enhancing accuracy of medical diagnoses. My dad had open-heart surgery a few years ago, and he only received this operation because he finally sought a second-opinion on some medical imaging of his chest that revealed a critical feature that his regular heart doctor had missed. Computer vision possibly provides a second-set of eyes for relatively low-cost (once in production phase) in diagnosing conditions in patients.

This dataset isn't looking at heart conditions, but I figured it would teach me a lot of similar techniques that could be employed in this area of research.

The notebook contains my exploration of the data and model-running, but for presentation purposes the pdf of slides gives a prettier look at my findings.

Enjoy!
